🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student who loves exploring new technologies and understanding how things actually work behind the scenes.

I’m currently focusing on Backend Development, where I enjoy building logic-driven systems, handling routes, managing data flow, and designing APIs. Frontend is not my primary interest (and AI makes it easier anyway 😄), but I still find creating interfaces exciting.

I enjoy learning new tech, but sometimes balancing time between multiple technologies can be challenging.
