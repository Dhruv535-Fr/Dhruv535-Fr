👋 Hi, I'm Dhruv

🎓 B.Tech CSE Student (3rd Year)
💻 Backend Development Enthusiast | Problem Solver | Tech Explorer

🚀 About Me

I’m currently focusing on Backend Development, where I enjoy building logic-driven systems, handling routes, managing data flow, and designing APIs. Frontend is not my primary interest (and AI makes it easier anyway 😄), but I still find creating interfaces exciting.

I enjoy learning new tech, but sometimes balancing time between multiple technologies can be challenging.

Currently Exploring:
Backend Architecture & AI/ML Projects

🎨 Hobbies & Interests

Drawing (sometimes, for relaxation)

Traveling & exploring nature

😄 Fun Fact

If we’ve met before, I’ll always remember you.
I might seem quiet at first because I’m shy and overthink — but just say Hi, and I’ll talk with you like we’ve been friends forever 😄
