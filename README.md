👋 Hi, I'm Dhruv

🎓 B.Tech CSE Student (3rd Year)
💻 Backend Development Enthusiast | Problem Solver | Tech Explorer

🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student who loves exploring new technologies and understanding how things actually work behind the scenes.

I’m currently focusing on Backend Development, where I enjoy building logic-driven systems, handling routes, managing data flow, and designing APIs. Frontend is not my primary interest (and AI makes it easier anyway 😄), but I still find creating interfaces exciting.

I enjoy learning new tech, but sometimes balancing time between multiple technologies can be challenging.

Currently Exploring:
Backend Architecture & AI/ML Projects

🎯 Goals

Short-Term:

Get physically fit

Secure an internship at a good company

Master backend development

Strong DSA revision & problem-solving

Long-Term:

Start career as a Backend Developer

Eventually try building my own startup 

🎨 Hobbies & Interests

Drawing (sometimes, for relaxation)

Traveling & exploring nature

😄 Fun Fact

If we’ve met before, I’ll always remember you.
I might seem quiet at first because I’m shy and overthink — but just say Hi, and I’ll talk with you like we’ve been friends forever 😄
